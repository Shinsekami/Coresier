# Furniture Price Finder

This is a small static website that uses the free [SerpApi Google Lens API](https://serpapi.com/google-lens-api) to reverse image search furniture and show shopping results sorted by price.

## Usage
1. Obtain a free API key from [SerpApi](https://serpapi.com/users/sign_up).
2. Host this repository on GitHub Pages.
3. Open the site and paste a public image URL of the furniture along with your SerpApi key.
4. Click **Search** to see shopping results (if available) sorted by lowest price.

The site fetches the API through a public CORS proxy so it works purely as a clientâ€‘side page.
